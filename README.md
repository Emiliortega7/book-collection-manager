This repository contains a Flask application designed to serve as the backend for a book collection manager. The project is structured to initialize the Flask app, incorporating necessary configurations to facilitate smooth operation across different environments. It acts as the central node, orchestrating the interactions between the user's requests and the system's responses. The application imports routes from "routes.py," which define the HTTP endpoints for operations such as adding, retrieving, editing, and deleting book entries in the collection. This setup aims to provide a scalable, maintainable, and easy-to-navigate framework for building a comprehensive book management system.
